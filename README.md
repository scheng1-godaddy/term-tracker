# term-tracker

This is an android application that allows students to create their class schedule for a term or semester. 

Android SDK Version: 22 (lollipop)

Some user stories:
1. As a user, I can create a new term
2. As user, I can create class(es) for that term
3. As a user, I can take notes for my classes
4. As a user, I can enter testing information for my classes
5. As a user, I can turn on notifications for when a test is upcoming
6. As a user, I can turn on notitifcations when a new class is starting. 

Future enhancements:
1. Going to use fragments for smoother interface. 
2. UX redesign
3. Maybe refactor using React Native or Kotlin.
